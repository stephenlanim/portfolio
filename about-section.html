<p>I'm a front-end web developer at UNC-Wilmington, expanding my skills to become a valuable member of a web-app development team.</p>

<p>I'm a front-end web developer, putting in my 10,000 hours toward mastering web-app design and development. I'm preparing to become a valuable member of a development team.</p>

<p>For the past three years, I've been doing a variety of web design and development work for various departments at UNC-Wilmington&mdash;redesigning websites, modifying SQL reports, and helping web content managers across campus from within the IT department.</p>

<p>For the past three years, I've been working independently as a consultant for various departments at UNC-Wilmington, making lots of folks happy with their website redesigns. But I'd love to become a part of a team and do work that is beyond my current skill level.</p>

<p>I've let my clients know that I'd be using them as references, so feel free to reach out to any of them.</p>

<p>I'm always learning new skills.</p>

<p>Last year, I completed Treehouse's Front-End Web Development Techdegree and am now completing projects in Stephen Grider's highly acclaimed Udemy courses on React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (the MERN stack).</p>

<p>I'm preparing to become a valuable member of a development team.</p>

<p>I initially learned user interface design, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as part of my master of science program in instructional technology. But after completing some front-end web development projects for some local clients, I was hooked.</p>

<p>Deciding to go all the way with web development was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I wish I'd discovered my passion and talent for web development ages ago!</p>
