Techdegree Notes:

I would like this project to be considered for an Exceeds Expectations grade.

<!-- The below note may be invalid. It may be possible for me to create an SVG sprite or individual SVGs that have transparent backgrounds, like Brendon Leyton's site. But I want them to change color on hover, which does't happen with Brendon's. I'll have to see if that's possible. -->
<!-- Images/Icons Note: Because I wanted the background image to show through the icons, SVG was not appropriate for this project. I instead used icons from FontAwesome and a PNG for the Treehouse icon. -->
